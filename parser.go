	the indicated exit to the next room.

	take :: acquire an object, putting it into your inventory.

	grab :: see take

	drop :: remove an object from your inventory, dropping it in the current room.

	eat :: restore your strength by eating an item

	pull :: see take

	whistle :: With the right item at hand, you can whistle to summon the family pet.

	call :: Call your parents to come get you.

	enter :: Type a secret password into a computer.

	climb :: Climb a desk. Maybe someday you can climb a mountain. Or even
	climb on the rest of the furniture ...

	use :: Make use of an item in your inventory.

	taunt :: Pick a fight!

	jump :: Get vertical!

	slide :: Travel quickly

	savegame :: saves the state of the game to a file.

	loadgame :: confirms with the user that this really is desired, then loads
	the game state from the file.

	exit :: save game and then exit.
