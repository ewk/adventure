	look :: Print the long form explanation of the current room.

	look at <feature or object> :: gives a fictionally interesting explanation of
	the feature or object. You should be able to "look at" objects in your
	inventory, as well. If you describe something in your text descriptions, you
	should be able to "look at" it to examine it.

	"go north" OR "north" OR "go dank-smelling staircase" OR "dank-smelling
	staircase" :: proceed through the indicated exit to the next room (note that ALL
	FOUR of these forms of movement are required, and thus require you to describe
	the exits appropriately). You might also decide to implement other room-travel
	verbs such as "jump north" as appropriate.

	take :: acquire an object, putting it into your inventory.

	drop:: remove an object from your inventory, dropping it in the current room.

	savegame :: saves the state of the game to a file.

	loadgame :: confirms with the user that this really is desired, then loads
	the game state from the file.

	help :: Print this message
